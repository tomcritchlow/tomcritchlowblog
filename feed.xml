      <description>&lt;p&gt;You ought to know Mr. Mistoffelees!&lt;br&gt;
The Original Conjuring Cat&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
(There can be no doubt about that).&lt;br&gt;
Please listen to me and don&amp;rsquo;t scoff. All his&lt;br&gt;
Inventions are off his own bat.&lt;br&gt;
There&amp;rsquo;s no such Cat in the metropolis;&lt;br&gt;
He holds all the patent monopolies&lt;br&gt;
For performing suprising illusions&lt;br&gt;
And creating eccentric confusions.&lt;br&gt;
At prestidigitation&lt;br&gt;
And at legerdemain&lt;br&gt;
He&amp;rsquo;ll defy examination&lt;br&gt;
And deceive you again.&lt;br&gt;
The greatest magicians have something to learn&lt;br&gt;
From Mr. Mistoffelees&amp;#39; Conjuring Turn.&lt;br&gt;
Presto!&lt;br&gt;
Away we go!&lt;br&gt;
And we all say: OH!&lt;br&gt;
Well I never!&lt;br&gt;
Was there ever&lt;br&gt;
A Cat so clever&lt;br&gt;
As Magical Mr. Mistoffelees!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is quiet and small, he is black&lt;br&gt;
From his ears to the tip of his tail;&lt;br&gt;
He can creep through the tiniest crack,&lt;br&gt;
He can walk on the narrowest rail.&lt;br&gt;
He can pick any card from a pack,&lt;br&gt;
He is equally cunning with dice;&lt;br&gt;
He is always deceiving you into believing&lt;br&gt;
That he&amp;rsquo;s only hunting for mice.&lt;br&gt;
He can play any trick with a cork&lt;br&gt;
Or a spoon and a bit of fish-paste;&lt;br&gt;
If you look for a knife or a fork&lt;br&gt;
And you think it is merely misplaced&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
You have seen it one moment, and then it is gawn!&lt;br&gt;
But you&amp;rsquo;ll find it next week lying out on the lawn.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we all say: OH!&lt;br&gt;
Well I never!&lt;br&gt;
Was there ever&lt;br&gt;
A Cat so clever&lt;br&gt;
As Magical Mr. Mistoffelees!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His manner is vague and aloof,&lt;br&gt;
You would think there was nobody shyer&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
But his voice has been heard on the roof&lt;br&gt;
When he was curled up by the fire.&lt;br&gt;
And he&amp;rsquo;s sometimes been heard by the fire&lt;br&gt;
When he was about on the roof&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
(At least we all heard that somebody purred)&lt;br&gt;
Which is incontestable proof&lt;br&gt;
Of his singular magical powers:&lt;br&gt;
And I have known the family to call&lt;br&gt;
Him in from the garden for hours,&lt;br&gt;
While he was asleep in the hall.&lt;br&gt;
And not long ago this phenomenal Cat&lt;br&gt;
Produced seven kittens right out of a hat!&lt;br&gt;
And we all said: OH!&lt;br&gt;
Well I never!&lt;br&gt;
Did you ever&lt;br&gt;
Know a Cat so clever&lt;br&gt;
As Magical Mr. Mistoffelees!  &lt;/p&gt;
